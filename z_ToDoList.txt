Pending tasks:
- Implement command to omit certain reactions from Guac's list (for a server)
- Implement the rest of economy
- Implement role blacklisting commands to disallow certain roles from talking to GuacBot
- Back up server data so that when Guac loading it fails, he just copies the backup to the main file and tries again. Successful runs copy the current server data to the backup file.
- Use NLPs to determine when personality reaches "weirdness event horizon" and automatically wipes its own memory.
- Use NLPs to determine when personality is being spoken to without need for keyword? (would probably replace random responses and proposed new system)
- Make it so that replies to Guac are treated as triggers
- Make responses actually reply to the message they respond to for clarification purposes
- Make sure that all server-specific actions are accounted for in private DMs
- Add a check that looks for if Guac is trying to send more than x messages and wipe his memory if so? (Possible "fix" for going coocoo for coco puffs)
- Let people give me their social security number so Guac can tell them happy birthday
- Add a list of people Guac has met and respond accordingly?
- Make it so that interactions completely get rid of modifiable memory then replace it with the last X messages for Guac to respond to. (No more feedback loop and automatic context separation)
- Give access to more context (I.E. what his current activity is)
- Look into newer (less corporate sounding?) models
- Look into adding an ability to use the internet to supplement contemporary responses
- Make a local website to interact with and see status on Guac. Possibly host a website to show status and metrics?
