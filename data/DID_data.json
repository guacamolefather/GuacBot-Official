They were characterized by brutal violence and atrocities committed on both sides, which ultimately led to a breakdown of trust between Christians and Muslims. The Crusades also resulted in the destruction of cultural heritage and religious sites, as well as the displacement of local populations. While there may have been some initial justification for the Crusades based on perceived threats to Christian pilgrimage sites, the prolonged and violent nature of these conflicts ultimately undermined any potential benefits. Instead, they contributed to a cycle of violence and mistrust that continues to this day",
