- 02/09/2024: GuacBot5.0.0
Gutting GuacBot to rebuild with OpenAI. Got rid of economy (minus json handling), NLP/txt reaction, and music related code.

- 02/10/2024: GuacBot5.1.0
Added AI chatbot functionality with JanAI API (GUAC IS A REAL BOY NOW). Switched reaction cog to use json files for data to make it easier to add, remove, and parse reaction triggers. Added triggerCounter to reaction cog to watch for an ne'er-do-wells (Fuck Daniel... was that his name?). Figured out weird typing thing where Guac would show to be typing even after sending his message
    
- 02/10/2024: GuacBot5.2.0
Gutted GuacBot of deprecated commands that no longer serve a purpose, given new Discord functionality. Switched "bridge" hybrid commands to slash commands for non-owner users, completely phasing out the prefix days. Added "version" command to show what version of GuacBot we are on. Other starting miscellaneous changes (such as comments) to code for clarity's sake.

- 02/10/2024: GuacBot5.2.1 (a bug fix update)
Fixed "$help" command to reflect intentions of last update (and invite command, which I accidentally left as a bridge command). This command now updates the version automatically based on the patch type.

- 02/12/2024: GuacBot5.3.0 (a minor update)
Fixed minor error in this command. Updated more information to reflect intentions with switch to slash commands as well as a few permission bug fixes to those commands (permission handling with slash commands is different). Another considerable chunk of commenting code (HQ and utility cogs) with minor fixes to error handling and the /profile command along the way. Guac now tells me when servers are joined/left.

- 02/12/2024: GuacBot5.3.1 (a AI tuning update)
Changed some of Guac's intructions for AI interactions to fix some common hiccups he has. He now knows the name of who he's talking to and that I am his creator (but I cannot figure out how to stop him from thinking I am everything's creator).

- 02/12/2024: GuacBot5.3.2 (an autism induced grammar update)
I didn't like that the patch said "a AI tuning update" when it should have said "an AI tuning update"

- 02/13/2024: GuacBot5.4.0 (a minor update)
Made an experimental function that allows GuacBot to build his memory (may or may not be temporary) for science! His brain (just message memory) is stored in a separate json file so if anything goes wrong, it doesn't fuck up anything important. He will default to the original function if the experimental one fails.

- 02/13/2024: GuacBot5.4.1 (a tiny memory plant update)
Just added a couple memories to Guac to hopefully clear up his confusion with his creator...

- 02/13/2024: GuacBot5.4.2 (a dementia update)
Gave back GuacBot his dementia but reversed time on it a bit so he can remember the previous 5 interactions (5 user messages and his 5 responses to those messages)

- 02/13/2024: GuacBot5.4.3 (a Sophie update)
I mean, she is pretty much Guac's auntie now...

- 02/13/2024: GuacBot5.4.4 (a Sophie v2 update)
I made an oopsie and fixed it...

- 02/18/2024: GuacBot5.5.0 (a minor update)
Added SalsAI personality to GuacBot's code? Not entirely sure how meaningful of an addition this will be, but the future may hold a possibility of running multiple models with different personalities, but for now, Guac just has DID.

- 02/19/2024: GuacBot5.6.0 (a minor update)
Implemented SalsAI and GuacBot as two separate profiles within the memory json. Tried to let them interact with eachother with a collective memory, but it just mixed their personalities too much (getting rid of the point of two personalities), so they have individual memory now. Properly set up prioritization if Guac and Salsa are both prompted in a single message. Fixed the non-AI reactions (no more jazz from "been" or "beer") and added commentary through the Reaction cog. Tiny fix to /profile command to show out of how many channels one has access to.

- 02/19/2024: GuacBot6.0.0 (a major (official GuacBot time) update)
Finished gutting out depracated (or otherwise redundant) functionality and fixing + commenting on what remained. Permissions fixed for all applicable commands. Took token out of code so that I can make the GuacBot repository public. Edited what server data is collected for moderation purposes (far less required), given slash command integration changes. Other small changes I can't remember, but are definitely important.

- 02/19/2024: GuacBot6.0.1 (a triggers update)
Added two new triggers according to the to-do list.

- 02/19/2024: GuacBot6.0.2 (a semi colon update)
Fixed a personal command that had a file location switch and another personal command that wouldn't work as a slash command because it DEMANDED an integer (everything is strings)

- 02/20/2024: GuacBot6.1.0 (a minor (catching up) update)
Moved the character limit function to a shared module instead of just reaction cog so it can be used all throughout GuacBot. Added command to wipe Guac or Salsa's short-term memory. Revamped todo command and added a command to fetch it without adding anything to it (both update my txt file appropriately now). Added whitelist for GuacBot AI functionality. Profile command now shows ban status (and what banned you). "Fixed" my cog (un/re)loading commands.

- 02/20/2024: GuacBot6.1.1 (a /adminprofile update)
I forgor to update /adminprofile with the /profile addition...

- 02/20/2024: GuacBot6.1.2 (a tiny reactions bug fix update)
I may or may not have used a Java method on accident that I had to fix... (I also definitely didn't forget a comma in one of the JSON files)

- 06/07/2024: GuacBot6.2.0 (a minor update)

- 06/07/2024: GuacBot6.2.2 (a oops update)
(Last patch notes:) I think there were little things I forgor to add to patch notes but the most recent fixes are just officially hiding owner commands from normies by making them old prefix commands so that people aren't confused as to which they can use. Also added command groups, so that commands are easier to find :)

- 06/08/2024: GuacBot6.2.3 (a tiny update)
Fixed responding to $wipe_brain command being used. Allowed Guac to rarely butt into conversations he wasn't a part of (experimental). Fixed incorrect math on pre-made reactions (is actually 1 in 3 now). Finishing touches on command groups and hiding owner commands. Consistency change for /uptime string formatting.

- 06/08/2024: GuacBot6.2.4 (a lowercase update)
I think I accidentally used a Java method again, had to change the case of a letter and it just worked...

- 06/09/2024: GuacBot6.3.0 (a minor update)
Added @discord.guild_only() decorators to applicable commands. Added clarification to profile commands. Changed some naming conventions for how personality data is stored and referred to. Implemented time permeance (personality knows when things were said). Changed system for detecting whether bot is being spoken to so that more personalities can easily be implemented without manually adding triggers into reaction cog. Personalities now have lists that act as nicknames that the personality will respond to and personalities now respond according to position in data dictionary (GuacBot will always respond over SalsAI if both are mentioned, due to dictionary placement) (will probably figure out how to establish priority based on who was mentioned first in a message again)

- 08/16/2024: GuacBot6.4.0 (a minor update)
I've been forgetting to run this command, so I think it's just been a shit ton of miscellaneous bug-fixes, but I need to push a commit so that I can start working on the next big update without breaking everything and having an unreliable backup... Thank you!
